What the script does

This script shall obtain data from both the csv files in the Resources folder and merge them.
It shall return the total releveant values from the csv files.
Then groups all schools results together and displays them as each specfic school's totals. 
Script highlights top and bottom 5 schools based on the % of students that score a pass in both reading and maths.
Script breaks down table to display. Each school and the scores relevant to either maths or reading by each year group.
Script then moves each school into a category based on how much they spend per student and displays average scores and percentage of students who passed subjects.
Script moves each school into a category based on the number of students at the school (the schools size) and returns the same results as above.
Script finally moves each school into a category based on the schoool type (government based or independent) and returns the same results as above.

Analysis of the data

When we look into the data, it is quite clear that the greater total spending budget per school does not mean that they shall have a greater percentage of students achieve a passing grade overall.
When looking further into this specific case we can find, the lower the budget the school have allocated to spend per student the greater % of overall passing students are produced.
We take a note that less than 75% of students in the local area achieve a passing grade overall.
It is also worth noting that of the 5 top performing schools there are 3 independent type schools comparatively when looking at the 5 bottom performing schools there is only 1 independent school in the group.
This was reinforced when looking towards the % of overall passing students from both school types. Independent schools had a greater % of overall passing students, by almost 6%. 
One other interesting thing to look at, is that the schools with a total student population of less than 2000, had a had a greater % of overall passing students, by at least 7.5%. 
A few conclusions that can be drawn from this, one is that students attending smaller sized independnt schools compared to large sized government schools are more likely to achieve a passing grdaed in both subjects. 
Another is that the more money allocated to be spent by the school per student does not equiate to a greater % of the students at the school achieving an overall passing grade.
With these things in mind it maybe fair to say,  students attending  small independent schools that have a lower budget to spend per student have a greater chance of passing both subjects overall than when compared to
a student who is a tending a large government school with a high budget to spend per student.
